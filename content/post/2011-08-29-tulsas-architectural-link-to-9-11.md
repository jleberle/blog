[Front page *New York Times** article](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/us/28tulsa.html) from yesterday on the fact that Tulsaâ€™s BOK Tower is basically a smaller version of the Twin Towers. It should be noted that the tower will become the second tallest building in Oklahoma upon the completion of the Devon Tower in Oklahoma City.
