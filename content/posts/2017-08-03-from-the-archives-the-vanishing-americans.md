<p>Here's a little article I pulled from a digital copy of <em>The Indian</em>, May 28, 1970:</p>

<p>What really drew my attention to the article was the blending of traditional identity with contemporary rock music, then I decided to see if they ever managed to get that record made. There's no entry for the Vanishing Americans in my encyclopedia of native music, but the band did end up touring with <a href="http://indianz.com/News/2013/010008.asp?print=1">Bonnie Raitt</a>. More importantly for me, Greg Zephier went on to become involved with the International Indian Treaty Council, an NGO formed in the 1970s to advocate for indigenous issues at the UN, and part of my dissertation. Zephier is also the father of Mato Nanji, the leader of Indigenous, a contemporary blues rock band.</p>
