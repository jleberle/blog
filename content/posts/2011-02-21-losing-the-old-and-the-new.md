Two interesting articles in the *New York Times** this morning, one wondering what happens to [writing in the margins](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/21/books/21margin.html) given the rise of digital books, and the other being [the decrease in long form blogging](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/21/technology/internet/21blog.html) by younger Internet users.

Iâ€™d assume at some point hipsters will return to writing in books and blogging someplace other than Tumblr.

Also of note: [Cable television is stealing the 10 PM time slot](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/21/business/media/21prime.html) from broadcast networks and [Greg Louganis is back](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/21/sports/21louganis.html) teaching kids how to avoid hitting their heads.
