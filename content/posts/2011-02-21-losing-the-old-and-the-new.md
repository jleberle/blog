<p>Also of note: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/21/business/media/21prime.html?hpw">Cable television is stealing the 10 PM time slot</a> from broadcast networks and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/21/sports/21louganis.html?hpw">Greg Louganis is back</a> teaching kids how to avoid hitting their heads.</p>
