<p><a href="hhttp://web.archive.org/web/20111018164730/https://davideharrington.com/?p=594">Interesting article on Turnitin.com</a>, a&nbsp;Web site professors and universities use to (hopefully) catch students passing off plagiarized work. Unfortunately the service has a variety of issues, the biggest of which is that it offers a (paid) service for students that tells them the parts of their papers that will get flagged should it get run through turnitin.com by their professor.</p>
