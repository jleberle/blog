[Gordie Howe Turns 85 Today](http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=662796)

A note from February: MSG, and Comcast Spectacor, the new management of the XL Center, [signed a new agreement](http://web.archive.org/web/20130620094236/https://www.courant.com/sports/hockey/hc-whale-0227-20130226,0,3653740.story) to keep the Whale in Hartford for a least three years. Great news. Bonus note: MSG "contemplated a name change because the company wanted to distance itself from Baldwin's rebranding."

ESPN's Uni Watch [asked readers to redesign uniforms for the Miami Dolphins](https://www.espn.com/blog/playbook/fandom/post/_/id/19559/uni-watch-readers-redesign-the-dolphins) and someone submitted [a Whalers inspired take](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8525/8540227714_3b7cc3a045_h.jpg).

EA Sport's classic *NHL '94* turns 20 and PuckDaddy [labels team specific themes](http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/10-greatest-things-ea-sports-nhl-94-roenick-143029155--nhl.html), including for the Whalers, the fourth best thing about the game.
