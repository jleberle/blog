> Just nine months into the job, Edmunson-Morton has already collected a variety of materials for the archives, including craft beer singleers, hops breeding reports and historic photographs. OHBA’s extensive Flickr and Zotero collections enable people to easily tap into beer and hops history with a few clicks. Acquiring a keg might just be another Friday afternoon chore for a frat boy, but for Edmunson-Morton, it’s part of her job. She recently brought back a cask from McMenamins, an Oregon chain of craft brew pubs.
