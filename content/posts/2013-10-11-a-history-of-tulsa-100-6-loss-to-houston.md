> It featured a flu epidemic, a future NFL coach, and a 49-point fourth quarter. A country music star caught a touchdown pass. The winning coach was a tactical revolutionary; the losing coach was the most beloved football hero ever to grace early-1950s Saskatchewan. It was the White Album of college football games, and it was played the day after the White Album came out. Oh, and it's still the last time a major college program scored 100 points. It was Executive Platinum Oak Cask crazy. And that's before you get to Dr. Phil's part in it.

All of this is just a nice reminder that things have been worse than Tulsa's abysmal 2013 season.
