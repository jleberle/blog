A few weeks ago now I was looking around Carhartt's website and decided to buy a few beanies, including this one:

I wasn't particularly attached to that beanie at time, more a spur of the moment purchase, but now I'm deeply committed to getting that beanie thanks to Carhartt's terrible website.

Here's the thing about that nondescript heather blue beanie from Carhartt's website: it costs $16.99 and is currently in-stock.

Here's the reality: it costs $16.99 and is most definitely not in-stock.

On my first order the beanie was cancelled, which was fine because again I wasn't super committed to it and the other one in the order shipped. I assumed the beanie got cancelled because it was low stock and I just missed out on the last one. But then I went to Carhartt's website and it was listed as in-stock. Confusing. I emailed Carhartt's customer service and noted the fact that the item was cancelled because it wasn't in-stock but their website lists it as in-stock. I assumed customer service would realize the issue and send the matter to someone in inventory to update. Instead I was told the beanie was out of stock when my order was processed but now back in-stock and I could go ahead and order it, sorry for the inconvenience.  

So I placed a new order and a few days later the beanie was again cancelled. Another email to customer support and another reply that the beanie was available. This is when I went from not caring about the beanie to caring about it. After two failed orders it was pretty clear the beanie was not actually in-stock and someone had either mis-entered the number they had or some number of them had been misplaced in the warehouse. Either way, I wasn't going to get my beanie, but Carhartt's stubborn refusal to acknowledge a simple issue made me wait it so much more.

So what have I done? I'm now on like order four or five, I've lost track honestly. But every time Carhartt cancels the order I go check the website, if the beanie is listed as in-stock I place a new order. The dance shall continue until I either get my beanie or Carhartt fixes their inventory.
