[Great column by Jeff Jacobs on Howard’s exit and the future of hockey in Hartford](https://www.courant.com/sports/hockey/hc-xpm-2012-06-27-hc-jacobs-howard-baldwin-column-0627-20120627-story.html). Spoiler: Professional hockey is probably done.

Even though I’ve been hard on Howard it’s important to note his failure won’t lead to the death of the AHL in Hartford (if it comes to that of course). Hockey in Hartford was dying before he got involved, as evidenced by the Wolfpack’s declining attendance even though the team remained successful on the ice. Hartford isn’t a hockey town, it’s a Whalers town.
