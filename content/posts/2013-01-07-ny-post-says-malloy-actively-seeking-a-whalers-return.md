<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Despite admitting last summer that it is “unlikely” NHL hockey would return to his state, Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy is not giving up on the slapshot dream, sources said.</p><p>The Democrat has formed a group to look into the possibility of bringing a team back to the Constitution State and has approached at least one deep-pocketed potential buyer of a team, sources tell The Post.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <em>Post</em> cites anonymous sources and the Governor’s staff has gone on the record that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130123213551/https://www.courant.com/sports/hockey/hc-malloy-ct-nhl-0108-20130107,0,1450843.story">they’ve been approached but haven’t actively done anything</a>. The report is strange given Malloy said last year on WNPR a return <a href="https://blog.jaredeberle.org/malloy-dont-hold-your-breath/">wouldn’t happen in the short run</a> and people shouldn’t hold their breath about the prospect. That being said, if the report is true, stadiums and sports teams are one of the go-to ideas for economic growth and they almost always <a href="http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2000/7/coates.pdf">end badly</a>.</p>
