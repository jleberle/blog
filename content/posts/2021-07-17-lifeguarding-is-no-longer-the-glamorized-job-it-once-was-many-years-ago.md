When I was in high school I took a lifeguarding class. It ran for a week and at the end you got your lifeguard certification and theoretically a potential job at the town's public pool. I never ended up using the certification but I've always thought lifeguarding was a pretty decent summer job (excluding potential presents in the pool and anyone in distress) and I was undoubtedly influenced by Baywatch which peaked in the middle of my childhood. In May the local paper reported that the town only had half their usual lifeguard total and had to cut open swim hours in half. The local YMCA hoped to get more people into emergency lifeguard classes and up the hours and for about 10 seconds I actually thought about applying. I didn't but glad [someone had the same idea](https://apple.news/AugDvyk6gQHGrX92gzdupOg) ($):

> Joshua Vish, at age 36, is the oldest lifeguard at the Dormont Pool. The job pays $15 an hour and is a dream come true, he said. Maybe even a life-saver.

> “It feels very much like, ‘Finally!’ ” Mr. Vish said of his new work.

> …

> “It’s like I got held back two decades, and now I’m starting all over again,” Mr. Vish said. “My life basically needs a reset.”

> He gives his young co-workers a wide berth, he said, and doesn’t socialize with them outside of work. It is a relief to know they can’t fathom the pain of his recent breakup, Mr. Vish said. He also lost the car in his breakup, so he walked to work until he got a 1997 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. 

The management company says too many people see the job as boring and it lacks the glamor it used to. I'm not sure lifeguarding a pool ever had glamor, there's a reason Mitch Buchanan was hanging out on LA beaches and not one of LA's [30 public pools](https://parks.lacounty.gov/swimming/)
