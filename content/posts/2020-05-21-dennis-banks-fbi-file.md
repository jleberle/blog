<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dennis Banks passed away on October 29, 2017. On November 1, 2017 I filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the FBI for any files related to Banks. Most of the FBI files related to the American Indian Movement have been public for a number of years but I was curious to see if the FBI would release anything new Banks following his death. After I filed the request the only thing I heard was a notice saying my request was overly broad and I could reduce the scope to enable faster processing.</p>

<p>Today, 932 days later, the FBI responded to the FOIA request with 210 pages of information. I can't say there's anything drastically new in the material, but I've uploaded them here for future reference.</p>

<p>The one thing I would note in the files is page 108 of the Custer files has a statement from a BIA employee who was also listed as involved in an "unofficial self-protective unit," more likely than not a reference to Dick Wilson's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Oglala_Nation">Guardians of the Oglala Nation</a>. This is worthwhile for two points: one the connections between Wilson's GOONs and the BIA; and it adds further backing to Peter Matthiesson's discussion from <em>In The Spirit of Crazy Horse</em> of where Wilson got the funding for the GOONs from, as the person interviewed primarily worked for the highway department of the BIA.</p>
