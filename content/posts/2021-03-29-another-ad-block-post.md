<p>Hi, me another random person, writing about ad blockers in Safari. It's been about a month <a href="https://blog.jaredeberle.org/is-there-a-good-safari-ad-blocker/">since the last post</a>, so why not another one?</p>

<p>Wipr did a good job blocking ads, but it also broke some sites on a regular basis. One in particular was NBC Sports' website, which was non-functional with Wipr enabled. Now I don't think this is Wipr's fault in particular. It seems to be more the result of Easlist/Easyprivacy breaking the website. The same issues presented in Adguard with Easylist and Easyprivacy enabled but didn't appear when Adguard's own privacy and adblocking filter sets were enabled instead.</p>

<p>So anyway, I dumped Wipr. I went back to Ka-Block/Hush combo with the added fact that I block things at the DNS level with <a href="https://nextdns.io">NextDNS</a> and the <a href="https://oisd.nl">OISD list</a>. This prevents the things I don't want (trackers, etc.) from even reaching my computer and the two add-ons clean up most of the issues that remain. OISD has been pretty good about not blocking stuff that it shouldn't, but maybe there'll be another post in a month about how this too has failed.</p>
