“Saturday Night in a Saloon,” Russell Lee, Craigville, Minnesota, 1937 ([LOC](http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?fsaall:1:./temp/~ammem_h9Sj::))

And as it appeared in “*Cheers*”:

Still from the opening credits of “*Cheers*,” Season 7 ([Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS0VQOHX7lM))

Thanks to the fine folks at Shorpy, [who highlighted the photograph last year](http://www.shorpy.com/search/node/cheers), you can [find out more about the town](http://www.lakesnwoods.com/Craig.htm"), and catch another view of our lumberjack turned Cliff Clavin stand-in.
