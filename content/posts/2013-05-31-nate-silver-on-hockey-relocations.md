<p><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/why-cant-canada-win-the-stanley-cup/?pagewanted=all">Traditional Nate Silver post</a> with lots of numbers and charts trying to answer why Canada hasn't won a Stanley Cup in 20 years. Mostly it boils down to bad luck but Silver looks at redistributing NHL teams to align with fan support, which mostly means lots of new teams in Canada. However by looking at number of searches for NHL in various cities, Silver pegs Hartford/New Haven fourth for American cities.</p>
