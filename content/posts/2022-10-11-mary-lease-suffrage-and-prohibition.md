When you teach lower level survey courses you find yourself relying on historical overviews that many times disagree on stats and figures. Most of these aren't a huge deal but I was viewing the [Wikipedia entry for Mary Lease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Elizabeth_Lease) a few weeks ago and something stuck out:

>Mary Elizabeth Lease (September 11, 1850 â€“ October 29, 1933) was an American lecturer, writer, Georgist, and political activist. She was an advocate of the suffrage movement as well as temperance but she was best known for her work with the People's Party (Populists).

What struck me was the statement that Lease was a suffragist and temperance activist because my lecture notes say essentially the exact opposite. Thinking my notes had been written down wrong and went and checked the source for the statement, Richard White's *The Republic for Which It Stands: The United States During Reconstruction and the Gilded Age*:

>Mary Elizabeth Lease of Kansas -- "Queen Mary of the Alliance" and perhaps its leading orator -- denounced demands for prohibition and women's suffrage as absurd. The key was economic reform.[^1]

This, to me, is a significantly different stance than Wikipedia proclaimed and in a debate between a well-respected scholar writing in a peer-reviewed book and Wikipedia, I'm taking the academic.

[^1]: Richard White, *The Republic For Which It Stands: The United States During Reconstruction and the Gilded Age, 1865-1896* (New York: Oxford University Press, 2017), 748.
