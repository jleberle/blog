If you don’t live in Oklahoma (or more generally the Southeastern US) you’ve probably never heard of [noodling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noodling). Even if you do know spend some time [reading Spencer Hall’s noodling experience](https://www.sbnation.com/2011/7/14/2271015/noodling-the-amateur).

Hint: The Animal Planet show on the subject is called “Hillybilly Hand Fishin’”.
