Driving home the other day one of the DJs on a random SiriusXM station mentioned that they felt Bruce Springsteen was singing about a character in all of his songs. Well, no shit. This isn't actually a new idea I said aloud to no one. Springsteen himself acknowledged in his Broadway show that he's made a career out of singing about stuff he's never actually experienced in his life (to his credit the DJ mentioned this). And that is the biggest criticism of Springsteen's music, it's a hollow career of a rich guy playing a poor man. When I taught a class dealing with music and American History the students generally hated Springsteen and many of them talked about how it felt weird for Springsteen to be singing about those topics. 

While Springsteen had made a career of singing about working-class Americans, what he's really done is construct a decades long story of a nameless American living through the legacies of the 1960s, the depressions of the 1970s, and the hollowness of the 1980s success. Springsteen's character could have any job and the basic story would still be the same. The characters of Springsteen's songs, beginning with 1973's *Greetings From Ashbury Park, N.J.* parallels the life of Bruce Springsteen, the real person, but the character is living in the world that begins with Nixon's downfall and culminates with 9/11 and the forever wars of the 21th century. The narrative does get lost after you move past 1987's *Tunnel of Love* but Springsteen (the artist) managed to construct a searing portrait of a fictional career from youthful experimentation throughout middle age depression. None of this is particularly novel or new, but I need to write about something, so might as well write about Springsteen.
