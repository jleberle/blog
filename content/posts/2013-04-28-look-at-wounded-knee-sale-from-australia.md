The Australia Broadcasting Corporation's Jane Cowan [travels to Wounded Knee](http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2013/s3744889.htm) to look at the potential sale of 40 acres of land by Jim Czywczynski. She leads with "â€¦an ancient culture feels very much alive" which is problematic because, well, it is alive. Additionally she follows others (who probably read the Wikipedia entry) and claims an FBI agent died during the Wounded Knee occupation. The agent suffered a gunshot wound during a firefight but didn't die, he went on to testify at the joint trial of Dennis Banks and Russell Means the next year.
