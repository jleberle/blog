The hand-drawn map (not done to scale) comes from the Library of Congress's [panoramic maps collection](https://www.loc.gov/collections/panoramic-maps). The full version can be [downloaded or viewed here](https://www.loc.gov/item/87692752/). Here's [some other historical maps from Oklahoma](https://www.loc.gov/collections/general-maps/?fa=location:oklahoma).

If you zoom in you'll notice there's a baseball stadium between Brady and Archer from Cincinnati to Detroit, a block west of the current ONEOk Field. The drawing could be a reference to Association Park, which was located between Archer and First from Elgin to Cincinnati according to [a timeline of Tulsa's baseball stadiums](https://tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/drillers/tulsa-s-pro-baseball-homes/article_e2d5c57e-0f19-5384-9c64-92c8da8b0147.html). Association park, however, closed in 1917.

Regardless of accuracy, the map provides a nice reminder of how much Tulsa has grown (or sprawled) in the last hundred years. Even by 1926, Tulsans considered the current fairgrounds, then a cow pasture, "so far out in the country."
