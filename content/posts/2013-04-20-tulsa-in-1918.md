<p>The hand-drawn map (not done to scale) comes from the Library of Congress's <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/">maps collections</a>. The full version can be downloaded or viewed <a href="https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/">here</a>.

<p>If you zoom in you'll notice there's a baseball stadium between Brady and Archer from Cincinnati to Detroit, a block west of the current ONEOk Field. The drawing could be a reference to Association Park, which was located between Archer and First from Elgin to Cincinnati according to <a href="https://tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/drillers/tulsa-s-pro-baseball-homes/article_e2d5c57e-0f19-5384-9c64-92c8da8b0147.html">a timeline of Tulsa's baseball stadiums</a>. Association park, however, closed in 1917.</p>

<p>Regardless of accuracy, the map provides a nice reminder of how much Tulsa has grown (or sprawled) in the last hundred years. Even by 1926, Tulsans considered the current fairgrounds, then a cow pasture, "so far out in the country."</p>
