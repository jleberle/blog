<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>…Malloy added, Connecticut is not close to landing an NHL franchise. “I don’t lie awake at night wondering how that’s going to happen,” Malloy said. “Because, it’s not going to happen in the short run.”</p></blockquote>

<p>I attended a game over Christmas break and the crowd was a decent size, but the team is averaging <a href="http://theahl.com/stats/schedule.php?view=attendance">less than 4,500 fans a game</a>. Hartford needs a new arena, but the NHL isn’t going to be part of it.</p>
