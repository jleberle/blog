## What's Here

This in many respects is my glorified junk drawer. This is where I put quotes, links, or other items. I found that I've liked over the years. You'll also find a number of posts with [basic tech-related issues](https://blog.jaredeberle.org/category/tinkering/), mostly to remind myself how I fixed things in case they break in the future.

I also tend to post some basic reviews of things I'm [reading](https://blog.jaredeberle.org/categories/reading/), [watching](https://blog.jaredeberle.org/categories/watching/), or [listening](https://blog.jaredeberle.org/categories/listening/) to. I also post [semi-regular media diets](https://blog.jaredeberle.org/categories/recap/) that cover stuff I've engaged with since the last time I posted one.

Beyond those there's a number of [history posts](https://blog.jaredeberle.org/categories/history/) of varying lengths and quality; some posts on [local issues](https://blog.jaredeberle.org/categories/local/) related to Connecticut (where I grew up and Oklahoma (where I live). 

Finally I have some old posts on The Hartford Whalers and Howard Baldwin's attempt to return to hockey in Connecticut. I think [they've held up pretty well](https://blog.jaredeberle.org/tags/whalers) over the last decade.

## Colophon

The blog is written by myself, Jared Eberle. I'm an adjunct instructor at Oklahoma State University, more information on that can be found on [my CV](https://jaredeberle.org). You can find my various social profiles under the link icon at the top of the page.

Over the years the blog has evolved from a Blogger site to being hosted on Tumblr and then a self-hosted website run with Wordpress, Jekyll, and Hugo, before returning to Wordpress. Previous versions were hosted on [everbecoming.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20090615000000*/everbecoming.org)[^1] and [northtonowhere.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20090615000000*/northtonowhere.com)[^2] Over the years I've let those domains lapse and have culled many of the posts from the older sites because they weren't worth migrating to the new sites and programs.

The blog is hosted on [NearlyFreeSpeech](https://nearlyfreespeech.net) and runs on Wordpress using the Ryu theme. My [CV](https://jaredeberle.org) is compiled with Hugo, a static site generator.

Most posts are written in [Marsedit](https://redsweater.com/marsedit/) or [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html) with the assistance of Markdown. All of my work is done on either a 2021 M1 iMac (Blue) or a 2021 11.9" iPad Pro.
